# Workshop in a compute cloud: not that obvious

> Markus van Dijk, [SURFsara](http://surfsara.nl)

_Background:_ SURFsara's predecessor SARA was founded in 1971 by the two Amsterdam universities and a mathematical research center. SURFsara is, since 1984, the national supercomputing center for scientific research and education in the Netherlands.

The SURFsara HPC Cloud is in operation for about four years and during that time accommodated several hands-on courses that use Virtual Machines for their students. We also hosted our own workshops teaching the use of the cloud.
As the name implies, the SURFsara HPC Cloud is set up for High Performance Computing and not primarily for stability. I will talk about what effects that had on these courses.

Our experiences should be useful for both course organizers and cloud providers who expect that a cloud-based solution is ideal.
Will new technologies like Docker and [fill in your personal favorite] help workshop hosting? I will share my thoughts on that topic with the audience who, no doubt, have their own experience on this matter.
