# The IFB cloud for bioinformatics training

The French Institute of Bioinformatics (IFB) is a national service infrastructure in bioinformatics and the French node of ELIXIR. The IFB’s principal mission is to provide core bioinformatics resources to the French life science community (academic and private partners) coupled to the required computing and storage capacity in a national bioinformatics cloud. To address the most common needs, a selection of major scientific software tools was made and they were installed in pre-configured virtual images (cloud appliances), ready to run on the IFB’s cloud. To date, 36 appliances cover different domains of the life sciences, for example appliances for clinical cancer NGS data analysis or for proteomics analysis workflows. IFB maintains a catalogue of these appliances (RAINBio) that  helps the cloud users to filter the virtual images list according to their needs in terms of tools or scientific topics (based on the EDAM ontology). IFB is also using lightweight virtualization (Docker) to provide life science researchers and engineers with bioinformatics tools and pipelines in containers ready to run in the cloud or locally to personalized their virtual research environment.

The IFB cloud is also used both to train users about the cloud usage itself (IBIs courses), and also for the training of bioinformatics master students and by supporting bionformtics tutorial and workshops.
