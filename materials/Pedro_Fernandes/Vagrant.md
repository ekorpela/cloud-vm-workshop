#Vagrant

In its simplest form of usage, Vagrant allows us to specify a virtual environment through a file names Vagrantfile, 
and manage a virtual environment using a virtualisation platform such as Virtualbox http://www.virtualbox.org for example. 
A set of simple commands to the shell of the host operating system will then suffice. The Vagrantfile can be shared with
our collaborators, so that identical environments can be easily created in different host systems. 

A first exercise, taken from the ARANGS16 course, consists of using Vagrant to get a tiny Linux system up and running.
