# Materials for the INFN cloud demo

The demo shows:

1. How to create a large VM with automatic configuration of a "class" of N students, with N a parameter customizable by the trainer. The students have a large shared space in which they (or the trainer) could put datasets or applications.
1. How to create a pool of N VM running a RStudio Docker with public IP
1. (video) How to automate further such procedure, with future perspectives (INDIGO DataCloud project)

The video is too heavy to push it to GitHub, but it can be found [here](http://www.ba.infn.it/~nicotri/Elixir_Workshop/demo_mesos_bioworkshop.mp4)
